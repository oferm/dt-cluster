Bringing parallel rendering to a Delta3D-project.

Personal computers are quite cheap nowadays, and may even be used to run high-end virtualizations or simulations. This is what we aim to do.

Our aim is to have a cluster of PCs run a CAVE-like environment at the VR-lab in Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola.
